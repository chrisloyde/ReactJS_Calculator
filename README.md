 A simple project to learn and study ReactJS. The goal is to create a simple and functional ReactJS calculator app
 which can perform basic mathematical functions.
 
 This is my first project developing with ReactJS; I started with 0 knowledge of ReactJS and learned as I went along.
 I decided to not follow any tutorials during this project because I did not want to copy and paste someone else's
 work, everything seen is a result of my own research and study into the ReactJS library.

 This project was developed using Jetbrains PhpStorm IDE.
